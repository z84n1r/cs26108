1. [20 pts] Consider Einthoven’s triangle of the frontal electrocardiogram (ECG) for the three electrodes RA, LA and LL shown below. The triangle is equilateral and the augmented lead vectors (aVR, aVL, and aVF) bisect the bipolar lead vectors (I, II, and III).

(a) [8 pts] You are given an instrument that outputs the six-lead frontal ECG. However, four of the leads are malfunctioning, and only leads I and aVF pro-vide useful outputs. Reconstruct the missing leads of the frontal ECG from the lead I and lead aVF outputs:
II =
III =
aVR =
aVL =
(b) [2 pts] Can you reconstruct the Wilson Central Terminal (WCT) from the leads I and aVF as well? Explain.
(c) [10 pts] You find that lead I measures zero, and lead aVF measures 1 mV. Estimate the direction and magnitude of the cardiac vector in the frontal plane. You may assume the distance between shoulders of the subject is roughly 60 cm.
2. [35 pts] An instrumentation amplifier (IA) and driven right leg (DRL) amplifier are connected as shown below to record a single-lead electrocardiogram while actively grounding the body. The electrode-skin interface resistances are RLA = 100 kΩ, RLL = 80 kΩ, and RRL = 120 kΩ. All opamps are ideal with infinite input impedance, and with supply voltages V+ = +3V and V− = −3V. The IA resis-tances are R1 = 1 kΩ R2 = 499.5 kΩ, R3 = 5 kΩ and R4 = 50 kΩ, all with 0.1 % tolerance. The DRL resistances are Ra = 2 kΩ, Rf = 999 kΩ, and Ro = 5 MΩ.

(a) [5 pts] What ECG lead does the IA output Vout represent, and with what volt-age gain?
(b) [5 pts] Find the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of the IA.
(c) [5 pts] Now consider that the IA is subject to an input capacitance of 10 pF on both the non-inverting and inverting nodes. Find the effective CMRR of the system for line noise at 60 Hz frequency.
(d) [10 pts] For a 60 Hz displacement current id with 20 µA amplitude entering the body, find the amplitude of the common-mode voltage vcm in the body, with the DRL connection as shown. How much improvement does the DRL active grounding offer over a passive ground connection to the RL electrode?
(e) [5 pts] The amplitude of the differential signal vd on the ECG lead is 1 mV. Find the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of the instru-mentation amplifier.
(f) [5 pts] What is the maximum magnitude of the short-circuit current that may enter the subject’s body? Explain.
3. [20 pts] Consider the PO2sensor below consisting of a Clark electrode and a tran-simpedance amplifier (TIA). The flow rate ϕ of the sample through the chamber is maintained constant at 1 mL/s, the solution in the buffer is 1 mol/L KCl, and the value of the TIA resistance is Rf = 1 MΩ.

(e) [9 pts] Indicate for each statement below whether it is true or false:
i. TRUE / FALSE: The electric field for a current monopole falls off as one over distance squared, 1/r2.
ii. TRUE / FALSE: Twisted pair wiring between the electrodes and the instrumentation for biopotential measurement reduces differential inter-ference.
iii. TRUE / FALSE: A microtipped manometer gives a direct measure of the blood pressure waveform.
iv. TRUE / FALSE: The sphygmomanometer registers systolic and dias-tolic blood pressure along with heart rate.
v. TRUE / FALSE: Indicator-dilution methods offer non-invasive means to measure cardiac output.
vi. TRUE / FALSE: The Doppler flowmeter transduces blood velocity into a frequency shift between transmitter and receiver.
vii. TRUE / FALSE: Partial pressure and saturation of blood gases are di-rectly related to each other.
viii. TRUE / FALSE: Double correlated sampling allows to remove a con-stant measurement offset from a bioinstrument.
ix. TRUE / FALSE: Pulse oxymetry leverages the pulsative flow of blood in the vasculature to measure both heart rate and oxygen saturation non-invasively.
